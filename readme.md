# My Sublime Text 2 Settings

## WARNING!

This setting is for me. I don't expect it to work any other environment.

BUT, if you willing to break your setting to use mine, you should be aware that I'm using:

- Mac OX 10.7.4
- Sublime Text 2 beta 2195 (as of 2012/06/08)

## Installation

### Using Git

Go to your OS X Applicatioin Support directory:

    cd ~/Library/Application\ Support/

Clone the settings repository using the command below:

    git clone https://github.com/Leeiio/Sublime-Text-2-Settings.git "Sublime-Text-2-Settings"
    
Backup your settings and use my Sublime Text 2 settings
  
  mv Sublime\ Text\ 2/ Sublime\ Text\ 2\ Backup/

    mv Sublime-Text-2-Settings/ Sublime\ Text\ 2/

### Download Manually

- Download the files using the GitHub .zip download option
- Unzip the files and rename the folder to `Sublime Text 2`
- Copy the folder to your OS X Applicatioin Support directory `~/Library/Application Support/`
